The 2.0 release of String::Scanf introduces an object-oriented interface
(works only for Perl release 5.005 and up) that should speed up repetitive
sscanf() operations.

Note that for the 2.0 release the old compatibility setting interface
set_compat() has been removed since there is no need to be able to be
backward compatible with the old release 1 bugs.
