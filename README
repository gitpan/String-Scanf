Hi,

	this the Perl emulation module for the C stdio library scanf().

	Perl 5 is required.

	The documentation is in pod format (see perlpod), you can
	view it by for example

		pod2man scanf.pm | nroff -man | more

	Note that the pod cocumentation should be quite readable "as is".

	I hope you enjoy this little hack. If you find any bugs
	please do not hesitate to tell me. If you feel like sending
	me presents please do not hesitate to bribe me.

	The Makefile.PL can be used like this:

		perl Makefile.PL

	If all is well (your Perl is installed ok), Makefile is
	created. Then you can test whether the scanf emulation
	works ok:

		make test

	You can install the module with

		make install

	This attempts to install to where the command 'perl' would
	like to see its library files. If you want/need to install
	somewhere else, rebuild the Makefile with

		perl Makefile.PL INST_LIB=/some/where/else

	After this you can attempt the

		make install

	and the scanf.pm should end up in /some/where/else.
