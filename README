Hi,

	this the Perl emulation for the C stdio library scanf().
	It requires Perl 5.

	The documentation is in pod format (see perlpod), you can
	view it by for example

		pod2man scanf.pm | nroff -man | more

	Note that the pod cocumentation should be quite readable "as is".

	I hope you enjoy this little hack. If you find any bugs
	please do not hesitate to tell me. If you feel like sending
	me presents please do not hesitate to bribe me.

	The Makefile.PL is useful only for 'make dist', that is,
	for me, not you. One cannot for example say 'make test'
	because of stupid some reason (my stupidity or the MakeMaker's).
	You can do 'perl t/scanf.t' after you have installed the
	String::Scanf. Or do this:

		mkdir String
		ln -s ../Scanf.pm String
		perl -I. t/scanf.t
