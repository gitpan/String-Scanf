	* Scanf.pm: Fix a bug reported by Mike Nolan <nolan@naic.edu>
	  where [efg] would parse "0123" and "0123." as octals, not as
	  decimals (as libc does).  For people who depended on the
	  old (more Perl-like, kinda) behaviour, there's
	  String::Scanf::set_compat('efg_oct' => 1);

	* Released as 1.3.
